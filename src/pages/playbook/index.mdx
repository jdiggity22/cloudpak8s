IBM Cloud™ Paks are enterprise-ready, containerized software solutions
that give clients an open, fast and secure way to move core business
applications to any cloud. Each IBM Cloud Pak™ runs on Red Hat® OpenShift®
on IBM Cloud, other public clouds, or on-premises. IBM Cloud Paks include
containerized IBM middleware and common software services for development
and management.

The IBM Cloud Pak Playbook covers the following IBM Cloud Paks, running
