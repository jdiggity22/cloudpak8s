title:  Installing Cloud Pak for Security
weight: 100
---
In this section we describe the installation of IBM Cloud Pak 
for Security. This document was written based on our experience
with installation on 
Red Hat OpenShift 4.2 running on x86 architecture. However, 
the purpose of this 
document is to be agnostic. In other words, Cloud Pak for Security (P4S) 
just requires OpenShift 4.2 to be installed as a base platform. 
It does not matter if it is on-premises, in the cloud, installed on bare-metal 
or on virtual machines. 

In the sections below, we will discuss both 
the **Online** and **Offline** install options for the Cloud Pak. 
You only need to 
choose one. The Online option involves installing by directly accessing
installation images from an entitiled registry location on the internet.
The Offline option involves downloading a large archive file containing
all the installation image files, extracting that archive, and installing
using those extracted files. Depending on your cluster environment and
policies, you will choose one option or the other. The Offline option is
often appropriate for "air-gapped" installations, where access to the 
internet is restricted or not allowed.

## **Prerequisites**

This installation chapter does not describe how to install or configure the 
underlying OpenShift platform. Prior to installing make sure you have 
a working OpenShift cluster with the required capacity. The installation
of OpenShift is described [here](/ocp/introduction).

- Check the [prerequisites chapter](/security/prereq) to make sure 
you have sized your cluster 
appropriately and you have sufficient capacity
- For offline installs make sure you have downloaded the Cloud Pak 
for Security Passport Advantage Archive (PPA) file and copied it 
to the installation server. 
See the [prerequisites chapter](/security/prereq) for more details.
- Offline installation will require the docker client to be 
installed on the 
installation server
- For online installs make sure you have an entitlement key to access 
the IBM Entitled Docker Registry

## **Cloud Pak for Security Installation**

Cloud Pak for Security 1.2 requires Common Services to be installed 
first. After that, Cloud Pak for Security can be installed using
either the Offline or Online option.

## **Installing Common Services**

<ul>
</ul>

1. Obtain the entitlement key that is assigned to your ID.

   1. Log in to 
   [MyIBM Container Software Library](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary) 
   with the IBMid and password that are associated with the entitled 
   software.
   2. In the Entitlement keys section, select **Copy key** to copy the 
   entitlement key to the clipboard.

2. Log in to the Install server (assuming you have a separate server 
for install) as a user with root permissions or as a user with sudo 
privileges.

3. Authenticate to the OpenShift server where you would like to install 
Common Services (your token can be copied from the OpenShift Console UI)

   ```
   oc login --token=<your_token> --server=<INSERT_SERVER_URL_HERE>
   ```

4. Log in to the entitled registry.

   ```
   sudo docker login cp.icr.io --username <username> --password <entitlement_key>
   ```

5. Create the secret.

   ```
   oc create secret docker-registry entitled-registry --docker-server=cp.icr.io --docker-username=<username> --docker-password=<entitlement_key> --docker-email=<docker_email>
   ```

6. Create an installation directory to store the IBM Common Services 
configuration files, and change to that directory.

   ```
   mkdir ~/common-services ; cd ~/common-services
   ```

7. Pull the installer image from the entitled registry by running the following command:

   ```
   docker pull cp.icr.io/cp/icp-foundation/icp-inception:3.2.4
   ```

8. Extract the cluster directory:

   ```
   sudo docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data:z -e LICENSE=accept --security-opt label:disable cp.icr.io/cp/icp-foundation/icp-inception:3.2.4 cp -r cluster /data
   ```

9. The step above creates a cluster directory, creates cluster 
configuration files , and copies the kubeconfig file from theauth folder 
of the 
cop 4.2 installation directory into the cluster directory

   ```
   cp <ocp install dir>/auth/kubeconfig ./kubeconfig
   ```

   or

   ```
   oc config view > kubeconfig
   ```

10. Update the `config.yaml` file. 
In the file, update the **cluster_node** sections with our clusters. You will need to add 
the nodes from your cluster. Use the exact node names from 
the `oc get nodes` command.

   - Add the storage class for your cluster in the **storage_class** field. The storage class must be a block storage provider. Use the exact node names from the `oc get sc` command.

   - Update the **default_admin_password** field with a suitable password

   - Define the **management_services** appropriate to your install

   - The following IBM® Cloud Private management services must be enabled:

     - logging
     - auth-idp
     - monitoring

   Example `config.yaml` file

   ```

9. Wait for all the pods' status to be `Running` in the
`CP4Security` namespace. 

   ```
   watch -n5 "oc get pods"
   ```

10. Add ldap to the cluster. For instance, IBM'ers could use the 
link below to add the Bluepages ldap.

   ```
   https://github.ibm.com/cp4s/cp4s-developer-tools/blob/991b8c3688dcd9f7c8e6c4c1ebf1ff74af3c9732/developer-docs/Bluepages%20LDAP.md
   ```

11. Follow the IBM Cloud Private instructions in 
[Add users to the team](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_3.2.1/user_management/add_user.html?view=kc).
