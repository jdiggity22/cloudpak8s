## **Installing Cloud Pak for Integration Then Cloud Pak for Applications**

This section describes the scenario of installing Cloud Pak 
for Integration first, followed by Cloud Pak for Applications. 

From the experience of the residency group, if you are wanting to 
install these two Cloud Paks in the same cluster, installing them in
this order is recommended.

The first step is to consider the prerequisites for the Cloud Paks you
want to install and to make sure your cluster has the required resources.

### **Cloud Pak for Integration Prerequisites**
* Refer to the Knowledge Center 
[prerequisites page](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGT7J_19.4/install/sysreqs.html) 
(Cloud Pak for Integration 2019.4)
for details on what is required before starting an installation.

### **Cloud Pak for Applications Prerequisites**
* Refer to the Knowledge Center 
[prerequisites page](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCSJL_4.x/install-prerequisites.html) 
(Cloud Pak for Applications 4.0.x) 
for details on what is required before starting an installation.
* Also consider the prerequisites for installing the Cloud Pak for Applications
developer tools. Prerequisites and installation instructions are provided in
this Playbook for [Mac](/apps/cp4a_install_dev_tools_mac/) and for
[Windows](/apps/cp4a_install_dev_tools_win/) workstations.

### **Cloud Pak for Integration + Applications** 
### **Combined Minimum Requirements (January 2020):**

For your convenenience, the combined resource requirements that were used
during the residency in January 2020 are shown below. You are advised to 
check the product documentation for the most current numbers for the 
releases you want to install.

| Node Type | Quantity| CPU | RAM | DISK 1 |DISK 2 | DISK 3 |
| :---------- | :------: | :-------: | :---: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Bootstrap | 1 | 4 | 16 | 100 | | |
| Installer | 1 | 4 | 16 | 120 | | |
| LB | 1 | 4 | 16 |120 | | |
| Master | 3 | 16 | 32 | 300 | | |
| Compute | 8 | 16 | 64 | 200|  |  |
| Storage | 3 | 4 | 16 | 200 | 500 |  |
| NFS | 1 | 2 | 8 | 500 |  |  |

## **Installation Instructions**

### 1. **Installing Cloud Pak for Integration**

The Cloud Pak for Integration can be installed following the instructions
in the 
[Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGT7J_19.4/install/install.html) 
or in the [Cloud Pak for Integration](/integration/introduction)
section of this Playbook.

### 2. **Before Installing Cloud Pak for Applications:**

#### **Potential Storage Class Issue:**Â 

   The Cloud Pak for Applications installer will use the default 
   storage class. If the solution steps below are not done, 
   the `CouchDB` installation will fail. The 
   Cloud Pak for Applications `Transformation Advisor (TA)` component 
   requires ReadWriteMany (RWX) storage. This means you need 
   at least one RWX storage volume available. The solution below 
   describes configuring NFS for RWX storage, which was the option
   used in January 2020.

   There should be an option to choose a storage class in 
   the `config.yaml` file. However,  this option did not exist at the 
   time of writing.

<ul>
</ul>

#### **Solution:**

1. Create an NFS export on an NFS server.
2. Define a Read Write Many (RWX) Persistent Volume (PV) 
on the cluster to point to your NFS export.
3. Change the storage class name in the Transformation
Advisor operator definition, so that it uses the NFS storage.

    ``` 
    oc edit crd transadvs.charts.ta.cloud.ibm.com 
    ```

Keep in mind that this configuration will be overwritten by installing 
a later release. The only alternative is to change the default storage class.

**Note:** The Cloud Pak for Applications installer will report 
that the installation completed 
even if the `Transformation Advisor (TA)` fails.

### 3. **Installing Cloud Pak for Applications**

The Cloud Pak for Applications can be installed following the instructions
in the 
[Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCSJL_4.0.x/install-icpa.html) 
or in the [Cloud Pak for Applications](/apps/cp4a_overview)
section of this Playbook.
