title:  Installing Cloud Pak for Data
weight: 100
---
In this section we describe the installation of IBM Cloud Pak 
for Data. This document was written based on our experience
with installation on 
Red Hat OpenShift 4.2 running on x86 architecture. However, 
the purpose of this 
document is to be agnostic. In other words, Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D) 
just requires OpenShift 3.11 or 4.x to be installed as a base platform. 
It does not matter if it is on-premises, in the cloud, installed on bare-metal, or on virtual machines.

**Important**: At the time of writing OpenShift 4.3 is the highest supported version for CP4D. OpenShift 4.2 seems to be the most stable.
