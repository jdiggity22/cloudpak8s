keywords: 'ibm,install,mcm, cp4mcm'

This section describes how to enable the monitoring component, after you have completed 
installing the core components of Cloud
Pak for Multicloud Management 2.0. The Cloud
platform used to test and document the installation here is OpenShift on 
IBM Cloud (ROKS), specifically an OpenShift 4.4 cluster. However, since 
OpenShift 4.3. and 4.4 are available on a variety of platforms, the 
instructions should be valid on whatever on-premise or cloud platform 
where you are running OpenShift supported versions.

The enablement of monitoring is well documented in the 
[IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFC4F_2.0.0/install/monitoring_config.html).
The installation process documented there uses a mix of the Openshift UI 
and the command line. 

As an alternative, this section of the Cloud Pak Playbook describes an 
installation exclusively using the command line. With this approach, it 
is possible to automate the installation by incorporating these commands
into shell scripts.

The syntax of the
commands in this description was correct at the time of writing. 
However, command syntax often changes over time for various reasons.
If you 
experience a command syntax error, please check the IBM Knowledge Center
or Red Hat OpenShift documentation for the latest syntax and adjust 
accordingly. If thtat does
not solve the problem, the authors of this section will respond on a best
efforts basis if you 
[open a github issue](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak8s/issues).

This command line based enablement of the monitoring function is only tested and valid for 
clusters running in an online environment. That is, the cluster has access to the internet.
For offline or airgapped installations, these instructions will not apply, and you will have
to follow the 
[IBM Knowledge Center Monitoring Configuration](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFC4F_2.0.0/install/monitoring_config.html)
documentation.

## Set up necessary Environment variables

If you have just completed the installation of the Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management core
components, you probably already have these environment variables set in your command line
environment. In any case, you should check to make sure they are defined as described below.
The final step in this section defines 2 additional environment variables whose values can
only be known after the installation of the core components. Be sure to at least define 
these variables, if you already have the others defined.

1. Log in to 
[MyIBM Container Software Library](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary) 
with your IBMid and password.
In the Entitlement keys section, copy the entitlement key to your buffer.

2. In your command line, paste this entitlement key into an environment variable.

```bash
export ENTITLED_REGISTRY_KEY="<Paste Your Entitlement Key>"
```

3. Define the other environment variables you will need for the core MCM component installation.

```bash
export ENTITLED_REGISTRY="cp.icr.io"
export ENTITLED_REGISTRY_SECRET="ibm-management-pull-secret"
export DOCKER_EMAIL="<Your Docker ID email>"
export CP4MCM_NAMESPACE="cp4m"
export CP4MCM_BLOCK_STORAGECLASS="ibmc-block-gold"
export CP4MCM_FILE_STORAGECLASS="ibmc-file-gold"
export CP4MCM_FILE_GID_STORAGECLASS="ibmc-file-gold-gid"
```

The value of `ENTITLED_REGISTRY` points to IBM's registry containing the software images. The values
of the `ENTITLED_REGISTRY_SECRET` and `CP4MCM_NAMESPACE` are arbitrary. You can use different 
values if you want. The `...STORAGECLASS` variables are populated based on the storage classes
available in the OpenShift cluster. The storage classes you have available will vary based on
the platform on which you are running your MCM OpenShift cluster. 
To find the available storage classes in your cluster, enter 
the command `oc get sc`.

4. Go to your OpenShift Cluster UI, and log in to your cluster. From the pull-down menu in 
the top right corner, click `Copy Login Command`, then click `Display Token`. Copy the command
line under `Log in with this token`, paste it into your command line and Enter to log in to your 
cluster. The command line is in the form:

```bash
oc login --token=<your_token> --server=<SERVER_URL>
```

5. Define the 2 additional post-install environment variables.

```bash
export YOUR_CP4MCM_ROUTE=`oc -n ibm-common-services get route cp-console --template '{{.spec.host}}'`
export CP_PASSWORD=`oc -n ibm-common-services get secret platform-auth-idp-credentials -o jsonpath='{.data.admin_password}' | base64 -d`
```

## Adding the Monitoring Storage Configuration

<InlineNotification>
For each of the commands in the following sections, it is recommended to wait a length of
time for each of these commands to fully complete before moving on to the next one. From 
our experience, we recommend a wait time of 3 minutes from the return of one command to
when you should enter the next command.
</InlineNotification>

4. Enter the following command:

```bash
oc patch installation.orchestrator.management.ibm.com ibm-management -n $CP4MCM_NAMESPACE --type=json -p="[
 {"op": "test",
  "path": "/spec/pakModules/1/name",
  "value": "monitoring" },
 {"op": "replace",
  "path": "/spec/pakModules/1/config/0/spec",
  "value": 
    {
      "monitoringDeploy": {
        "cnmonitoringimagesource": {
          "deployMCMResources": true
        },
        "global": {
          "environmentSize": size0,
          "persistence": {
            "storageClassOption": {
              "cassandrabak": none,
              "cassandradata": $CP4MCM_BLOCK_STORAGECLASS,
              "couchdbdata": $CP4MCM_BLOCK_STORAGECLASS,
              "datalayerjobs": $CP4MCM_BLOCK_STORAGECLASS,
              "elasticdata": $CP4MCM_BLOCK_STORAGECLASS,
              "kafkadata": $CP4MCM_BLOCK_STORAGECLASS,
              "zookeeperdata": $CP4MCM_BLOCK_STORAGECLASS
            },
            "storageSize": {
              "cassandrabak": 50Gi,
              "cassandradata": 50Gi,
              "couchdbdata": 5Gi,
              "datalayerjobs": 5Gi,
              "elasticdata": 5Gi,
              "kafkadata": 10Gi,
              "zookeeperdata": 1Gi
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
]"
```

## Enabling the Monitoring Component

5. Enter the following command.

```bash
oc patch installation.orchestrator.management.ibm.com ibm-management -n $CP4MCM_NAMESPACE --type=json -p='[
 {"op": "test",
  "path": "/spec/pakModules/1/name",
  "value": "monitoring" },
 {"op": "replace",
  "path": "/spec/pakModules/1/enabled",
  "value": true }
]'
```


10. The enablement of the monitoring component will start a number of additional pods. The 
installation will be finished when all those additional pods have started successfully. This 
command will report these pods that are not yet in the `Running` or `Completed` states yet.

```bash
oc get po --no-headers=true -A | grep -v 'Running\|Completed\|gateway-kong' | grep 'kube-system\|ibm-common-services\|management-infrastructure-management\|management-monitoring\|management-operations\|management-security-services'
```

   Do not move on to the next command until all the addtional pods have completed. Keep 
   repeating the command above until the list comes back empty.

## Patching the Monitoring Deployable Secret

11. Enter the following commands.

```bash
export ENTITLED_REGISTRY_DOCKERCONFIG=`oc get secret $ENTITLED_REGISTRY_SECRET -n $CP4MCM_NAMESPACE -o jsonpath='{.data.\.dockerconfigjson}'`
execlog oc patch deployable.app.ibm.com/cnmon-pullsecret-deployable -p `echo {\"spec\":{\"template\":{\"data\":{\".dockerconfigjson\":\"$ENTITLED_REGISTRY_DOCKERCONFIG\"}}}}` --type merge -n management-monitoring
```
