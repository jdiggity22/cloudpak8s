The minimum hardware requirements for the Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management
hub cluster are simply stated on the 
[IBM Knowledge Center requirements page](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFC4F_2.0.0/install/hardware_reqs.html).

These requirements are summarized as follows:

| **Master/Worker** | **Nodes** | **CPU(Cores/Node)** | **Memory (GB/Node)** |
|:------------------|:----------|:--------------------|:----------|
| Master | 3 | 8 | 24|
| Worker | 4+ | 8 | 32 |

Also, a persistent volume greater than 161 GB is required.

Most importantly, [IBM Support](https://www.ibm.com/mysupport/s/) is 
prepared to provide specific sizing guidance for your desired set of 
components and environment. The
[IBM Knowledge Center requirements page](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFC4F_2.0.0/install/hardware_reqs.html)
provides the instructions for how to get this guidance.

The IBM Knowledge Center documentation also provides guidance on:
- [Storage Options](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFC4F_2.0.0/install/storage.html)
- [Supported OpenShift versions and platforms](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFC4F_2.0.0/install/supported_os.html)
- [Supported cloud providers for Cluster API, hub cluster, and managed clusters](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFC4F_2.0.0/mcm/manage_cluster/cloud_providers.html)

Be sure to check these pages on the IBM Knowledge Center when it is time for 
your installation, since these requirements could change.
