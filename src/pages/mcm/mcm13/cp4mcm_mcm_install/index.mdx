<PageDescription>

In this section we will walk through the installation of the MCM component of the Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management. This document is specifically written for installations on Red Hat OpenShift 4.2 running on an x86 architecture. The purpose of this document is to be agnostic. In other words.... MCM requires OpenShift 4.2 to be installed we don't care if it is on-prem or in the cloud or bare-metal or virtual machines. In the sections below we will discuss the Online vs Offline install, both of which are very similar with differences in the location of the MCM installation images. Please review the Configuring your installation section to understand the available installation options prior to installation.

**Update:** This document was recently updated to include Cloud Pak for MultiCloud Mangement v1.3.

</InlineNotification>

## Prerequisites

This document does not describe how to install or configure the underlying OpenShift platform. So prior to installing make sure you have a working OpenShift cluster with the required capacity.

- Check the requirements doc to make sure you have size your cluster appropriately and you have capacity
- For offline installs make sure you have downloaded the Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management Passport Advantage Archive (PPA) file (see requirements) and copied it to the installation server
- For online installs make sure you have an entitlement key from [MyIBM Container Software Library](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary) to access the IBM Entitled Docker Registry 
- The installation is performed from the Command line (CLI) so you will need the required CLI tools to interface with the cluster. Instructions on setting up the required CLI tools here: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFC4F_1.2.0/cli/cli_guide_mcm.html
- Offline installation will require the docker client install on the installation server

**Common Passport Advantage Part Numbers**
- **CC5W4EN** - IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management Core 1.3 Kubernetes image for AMD64
- **CC4L8EN** - IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management Core 1.2 Kubernetes image for AMD64

## Configuring your installation

This section will attempt to describe the options available for the MCM Installation.

Below is the config.yaml extracted from the inception image:

```

Here we will describe each of the relevant sections in the context of this doc.

- **cluster_nodes** - This section describes which nodes in your cluster the MCM components are allowed to run. The MCM Foundation components are split into three sections master, proxy and management. It is recommended that the master and proxy components run on the same nodes and that the management components run on dedicated nodes. The number of nodes you specify in each section determines the number of nodes that the work can be split across and will determine the level availability you can achieve. If you specify one node in each of the sections and that node goes down you will lose your ability to use MCM. If you have capacity it is a good idea to have multiple nodes in each section.

It is important to note that having the master nodes in the config.yaml does not
 mean you should add your OpenShift Master nodes in that section. It 
 is **NOT** recommended to run any of the MCM components on your 
 OpenShift Master nodes.

- **storage_class** - The storage class is the dynamic storage class that the installer will use when creating persistent volumes. This storage class should be a `block ` storage provider. Generally faster disk is preferred.

- **default_admin_password** - The default_admin_password is the password that will be assigned the default admin user to authenticate to the MCM application. It is recommended that the password be set to a password that meets your organizations password requirements. Use the stanza below as an example:

```yaml
default_admin_password: <your password>
password_rules:
- '(.*)'
```

- **management_services** - In the management_service section you can enable or disable some the MCM Foundation components that are available. The default values are generally sufficient for an MCM install. If you require the additional service you can enable them, but note that they may require additional capacity and customization not covered in this document. Note that the MCM services are enabled at the end of this section.

- **Additional considerations** - If you want to deploy MCM in an highly available configuration you will want to add some additional sections to increase the number of replicas and enable persistance for each of the MCM Components. See the sample stanza below:

```yaml
multicluster-hub:
  global:
    replicas: 3
  etcd:
    haMode: true
    persistence: true
    storageclassName: <your storage class>
  core:
    apiserver:
      etcd:
        haMode: true
```

## Offline Installation

**1.** Login to the OpenShift Install server.

**2.** Authenticate to the OpenShift server where you would like to install MCM (these can be copied from the OpenShift Console UI)

```bash
oc login --token=<your_token> --server=<INSERT_SERVER_URL_HERE>
```

**3.** Navigate to the folder containing the line PPA archive package and extract and load the PPA Archive ( this may take ~10-20)

<Tabs>

<Tab label="CloudPak v1.3">

```
tar xf ibm-cp4mcm-core-1.3-x86_64.tar.gz -O | sudo docker load
```

</Tab>
<Tab label="CloudPak v1.2">

```
tar xf ibm-cp4mcm-core-1.2-x86_64.tar.gz -O | sudo docker load
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

**4.** Create a working directory

```bash
mkdir ibm-multicloud-manager ; cd ibm-multicloud-manager
```

**5.** Extract the installation configuration files. We will modify these to customize our installation.


<Tabs>

<Tab label="CloudPak v1.3">

```
sudo docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data:z -e LICENSE=accept --security-opt label:disable ibmcom/mcm-inception-amd64:3.2.5 cp -r cluster /data
```

</Tab>
<Tab label="CloudPak v1.2">

```
sudo docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data:z -e LICENSE=accept --security-opt label:disable ibmcom/mcm-inception-amd64:3.2.3 cp -r cluster /data
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>



**6.** Create your kubeconfig file for the installer to use

```bash
oc config view --raw > cluster/kubeconfig
```

**7.** Next we will need to update the **cluster_node** sections with our clusters. You will need to add the nodes from your cluster. Use the exact node names from the `oc get nodes` command.

**8.** Add the storage class for your cluster in the **storage_class** field. The storage class must be a block storage provider. Use the exact node names from the `oc get sc` command.

**9.** Update the **default_admin_password** field with a suitable password

**10.** Define the **management_services**  appropriate to your install

**11.** Start the installation (this can run for ~30-45min)

<Tabs>

<Tab label="CloudPak v1.3">

```
sudo docker run -t --net=host -e LICENSE=accept -v $(pwd):/installer/cluster:z -v /var/run:/var/run:z -v /etc/docker:/etc/docker:z --security-opt label:disable ibmcom/mcm-inception-amd64:3.2.5 install-with-openshift

</Tabs>

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** The command above will fail if you have spaces in your directory path. Run `pwd` to verify your path and remove spaces, then re-run installation command.

</InlineNotification>

**12.** Connect to the MCM hub console using the `icp-console` route defined in OCP. Use the `oc get routes -A` command to get the domain. You can access the MCM Console via a browser with the icp-console domain and the credentials you specified in the config.yaml.

## Online Installation

**1.** Log in to [MyIBM Container Software Library](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary) with the IBMid and password that are associated with the entitled software.
In the Entitlement keys section, copy the entitlement key. This key will be used in the steps to follow.

**2.** Authenticate to the OpenShift server where you would like to install MCM (these can be copied from the OpenShift Console UI)

```bash
oc login --token=<your_token> --server=<INSERT_SERVER_URL_HERE>
```

**3.** Login to the public docker repo using your entitlement key
   ```bash
docker login cp.icr.io --username cp --password <your entitlement key>
   ```

**7.** Create your kubeconfig file for the installer to use.
   ```bash
oc config view --raw > cluster/kubeconfig
   ```
**8.** Change to the cluster directory.
   ```bash
