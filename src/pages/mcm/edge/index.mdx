## Prerequisties

<ul>
</ul>

1. Install IBM CP4MCM 1.3
2. A macOS or Ubuntu Linux Host
3. Openshift Client CLI [Download](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest-4.3/)

`https://<ICP_CLUSTER_URL>/common-nav/cli`
   1. Kubernetes CLI (**kubectl**)

## Installing IBM Edge Computing Manager for Devices 4.0

<ul>
</ul>

1. Set the `ICP_CLUSTER_URL` environment variable. This value can be 
obtained from the output of the Management Hub install:

   ```shell
   export ICP_CLUSTER_URL=https://$(oc get routes -n kube-system icp-console -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
   ```

2. Connect to your cluster with cluster administrator privileges, 
selecting **kube-system** as the namespace and 
**fill in the password** you defined in the `config.yaml` file during the 
Management Hub install:

   ```shell
    cloudctl login -a $ICP_CLUSTER_URL -u admin -p <your-icp-admin-password> -n kube-system --skip-ssl-validation
   ```

3. Define the image registry host, configure the Docker CLI to trust 
the self-signed certificate: 

   ```shell
    export REGISTRY_HOST=$(oc get routes -n openshift-image-registry default-route -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
   ```

   <InlineNotification>
   Note: Please note on some clusters image registry might not have been exposed yet for first time, please run following optional command if you have issue with above command)
   </InlineNotification>

   ```shell
   oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"defaultRoute":true}}' --type=merge
   ```

   <Tabs>

   <Tab label="For MacOS">

   **Trust the certificate**

   ```
   mkdir -p ~/.docker/certs.d/$REGISTRY_HOST && \
   echo | openssl s_client -showcerts -connect $REGISTRY_HOST:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -outform PEM > ~/.docker/certs.d/$REGISTRY_HOST/ca.crt && \
   sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ~/.docker/certs.d/$REGISTRY_HOST/ca.crt
   ```
    
   **Restart the Docker service from the menu bar**

   </Tab>
   
   <Tab label="For Ubuntu">

   **Trust the certificate**

   ```
   mkdir /etc/docker/certs.d/$REGISTRY_HOST && \
   echo | openssl s_client -showcerts -connect $REGISTRY_HOST:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -outform PEM > /etc/docker/certs.d/$REGISTRY_HOST/ca.crt && \
   sudo service docker restart
   ```
    
   </Tab>

   </Tabs>

4. Login to the OpenShift Container Platform 4.3.x image registry:

   ```shell
   docker login $REGISTRY_HOST -u $(oc whoami) -p $(oc whoami -t)
   ```

5. Unpack the IBM Edge Computing Manager for Devices installation 
compressed file that was downloaded from IBM Passport Advantage:

   ```shell
    tar -zxvf ibm-ecm-4.0.0-x86_64.tar.gz && \
    cd ibm-ecm-4.0.0-x86_64
   ```

6. Create a new namespace `ibmcom`.

   ```shell
   oc new-project ibmcom
   ```

7. Load the archive content into the catalog, and the images into 
the registry's `ibmcom` namespace:

   ```shell
   cloudctl catalog load-archive --archive ibm-ecm-prod-catalog-archive-4.0.0.tgz --registry $REGISTRY_HOST/ibmcom
   ```

8. Extract the chart compressed file content to the current directory 
and move into the directory created:

   ```shell
   tar -O -zxvf ibm-ecm-prod-catalog-archive-4.0.0.tgz charts/ibm-ecm-prod-4.0.0.tgz | tar -zxvf - && \
   cd ibm-ecm-prod
   ```

9. Install the Chart.

   ```bash
   ./ibm_cloud_pak/pak_extensions/full-install/install-edge-computing.sh
   ```

   <InlineNotification>
   Depending on your network speeds, it will take a  few minutes for the images to download, for pods to transition into  RUNNING state, and all of the services to become active.
   </InlineNotification>

   **Verifying the Chart**

   - The script above verifies that the pods are running and the  agbot and exchange are responding. Look for a "RUNNING" and "PASSED"  message towards the end of the installation.
   - If "FAILED", the output will ask you to look at specific logs for more information
   - If "PASSED", the output will show details of tests that were run, and two more items to verify          
     - Browse to the IBM Edge Computing Manager UI console at the 
     URL given at the end of the log. `https://<ICP_CLUSTER_URL>/edge`

## Post installation configuration

<InlineNotification>
Note: Run the following commands from the same host where you ran the initial installation)
</InlineNotification>

<ul>
</ul>

1. Set the ICP_CLUSTER_URL environment variable. This value can be 
obtained from the output of the Management Hub install:

   ```shell
   export ICP_CLUSTER_URL=https://$(oc get routes -n kube-system icp-console -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
   ```

2. Connect to your cluster with cluster administrator privileges, 
selecting **kube-system** as the namespace and 
**fill in the password** you defined in the `config.yaml` file during the 
Management Hub install:

   ```shell
   cloudctl login -a $CLUSTER_URL -u admin -p <your-icp-admin-password> -n kube-system --skip-ssl-validation
   ```

3. Install the **hzn** CLI with either the Ubuntu Linux or macOS package installers that are found under **horizon-edge-packages** in the appropriate OS/ARCH directory from the compressed content extracted in step 5 of the Installation process above:

   - Ubuntu Linux example:

     ```shell
     sudo dpkg -i horizon-edge-packages/linux/ubuntu/bionic/amd64/horizon-cli*.deb
     ```

   - macOS example:

     ```shell
     sudo installer -pkg horizon-edge-packages/macos/horizon-cli-*.pkg -target /
     ```

4. Export the following variables that are needed for the next steps:

   ```shell
   export EXCHANGE_ROOT_PASS=$(oc -n kube-system get secret edge-computing -o jsonpath="{.data.exchange-config}" | base64 --decode | jq -r .api.root.password)
   export HZN_EXCHANGE_URL=https://$(oc get routes -n kube-system icp-console -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')/ec-exchange/v1
   export HZN_EXCHANGE_USER_AUTH="root/root:$EXCHANGE_ROOT_PASS"
   export HZN_ORG_ID=IBM
   ```

5. Run the following command to trust the OpenShift Container Platform 4.3 Certificate Authority:

   ```shell
    oc --namespace kube-system get secret cluster-ca-cert -o jsonpath="{.data['tls\.crt']}" | base64 --decode > /tmp/icp-ca.crt
   ```

   - Ubuntu Linux example:

     ```shell
     sudo cp /tmp/icp-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates && sudo update-ca-certificates
     ```

   - macOS example:

     ```shell
     sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /tmp/icp-ca.crt
     ```

6. Run the following command to create a signing key pair.

   ```shell
   hzn key create <company-name> <owner@email>
   ```

7. Run the following command to confirm that the setup can communicate with the IBM Edge Computing Manager for Devices exchange API:

   ```shell
    hzn exchange status
   ```

8. Populate sample edge services by running the following command:

   ```shell
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-horizon/examples/v4.0/tools/exchangePublishScript.sh | bash
   ```

9. Run the following commands to view some of the services and policies  that were created in the IBM Edge Computing Manager for Devices  exchange:

   ```shell
    hzn exchange service list IBM/
    hzn exchange pattern list IBM/
    hzn exchange service listpolicy IBM/ibm.helloworld_1.0.0_amd64
    hzn exchange service listpolicy IBM/ibm.cpu2evtstreams_1.4.3_amd64
   ```

## Uninstalling IBM Edge Computing Manager for Devices 4.0

Return to the location of the chart unpacked as part of installation  
and run the provided uninstall 	script. This script will uninstall 
the  helm release and all associated resources. First, login to the 
cluster  as a cluster administrator by using **cloudctl**, and then 
run:

```shell
./ibm_cloud_pak/pak_extensions/uninstall/uninstall-edge-computing.sh <cluster-name>
```
