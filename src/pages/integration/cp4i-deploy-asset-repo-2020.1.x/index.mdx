Version 2020.2 is out for Cloud Pak for Ingegration.  This version is the first to feature Operators and has significant changes to the deployment and operations.  Please refer to the [Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGT7J_20.2/overview.html) while we update this playbook.  Thanks!

### **Introduction**
This page contains guidance on how to configure the Asset Repository
release for both on-prem and IBM Cloud.

<ul>
</ul>

### **Prepare Installation**

1. You have a few choices on where you can deploy the Asset Repository.
You can either deploy it to the `integration` namespace or wherever your
platform navigator is installed, or in some cases (like IBM Cloud) where a
separate namespace will be created for the asset repository.
2. The Asset Repository Requires the use of persistent storage, like
gluster-fs and/or ceph.  Note that there are some parts of the Asset Repo
that work better with block storage (like Cloudant).  These will be called
out in the installation instructions below.
3. To use the remote syncing capability into github, a publically facing
github account is required.  More info on this can be found
[here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGT7J_19.4/asset_repo.html).
4. Note that the default replica set size for the install for all of the
asset repo components is 3.  For POC/Dev type systems, you can scale these
back to one replica to save resources.  However note this is *NOT*
recommended for production systems.
5. You might need to add permissions for your namespace, depending on
where you are installing the asset repository.  Use the following commands
and replace the last &lt;namespace&gt; argument with your targeted
namespace.  If you are installing this into the same namespace where the
platform navigator is located, use that namespace (e.g. `integration`).

```
oc adm policy add-scc-to-group ibm-anyuid-scc system:serviceaccounts:&lt;namespace&gt;
```

<ul>
</ul>

### **Begin Installation**
1. Go to CP4I Platform Home. Click **Create Instance** inside
the **Asset Repo** tile.
2. A window will pop up with a description of the requirements for
installing. Click **Continue** to the helm chart deployment configuration.
3. Click **Overview** to view the chart information and pre-reqs.
4. Click **Configure**
5. Enter the Helm release name. In our example, **asset-repo**
6. Enter Target Namespace.  As indicated above, this can be in
the `integration` namespace or another namespace setup for you.
7. Select a Cluster - **local-cluster**.
8. Tick the license agreement box.
9. Under Parameters -> Quick start
   a. Hostname of the ingress proxy to be configured - This will be your
   proxy node for your install.
10.  Click All Parameters twisty
11. Image Pull Secret -> Set to `ibm-entitlement-key` if using entitled
registry or if offline use the `deployer-dockercfg-XX` secret in your
ace namespace.  Use `oc get secrets` to get the exact value for your
environment.
12. Untick the `Production usage` checkbox.
13. Double check that the `Platform Navigator Namespace` is set properly
for your environment.
14. For `Cloudant metadata store storage class` set that value to your
block storageclass.  Non-block will work fine here too, but block will
definitely be faster.
15. As you go through the chart, you can scale down the replicas
for `Cloudant`, `Catalog API`, `DC main`, `Portal Catalog`,
`Asset Storage`, `Portal Common` and `Catalog Remotes` from 3 to 1.
16. Be sure to also set the `Asset storage Storage Class` and
`Catalog remotes Storage Class` to your non-block storage.
17. Scroll down and then Click **Install** to fire off the chart
installation
